# Ether Marketplace

Ether Marketplace is my first introduction into blockchain development using ReactJs as well as Solidity.

## Requirements to run
- Truffle
- npm 
- Ganache
- Metamask

## How to run

1. Start Ganache and create a new workspace
2. Within your browser, go to metamask, connect to local Ganache instance
3. Import two accounts from Ganache to your metamask
    - 1 should be the seller
    - 2 Should be the buyer
4. Within the console, run truffle compile
5. Run truffle migrate
6. Run npm install
7. Run npm run start
8. Once the browser opens, connect your metamask account for the seller
